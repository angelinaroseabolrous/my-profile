<p>I was born in Kirkland, Washington and grew up near Seattle, in the suburbs called Bellevue. I'm half Estonian and half Egyptian. I spent 7 years in Washington until my parents decided it would be a good idea to mve to Estonia! They wanted my sister and I to have different point of views on life. I am super thankful because living in many places has really taught me a lot! WHen residing in the US, I attended a French School and therefore have always been fond of the culture. That's why I'm so happy to be here in France at the moment! I am a very warm, empathetic, and ambitious person with many hobbies. You will discover my interests as you scroll down my page!

<p> Traveling is a big part of my life as I've been doing it since a very young age. I was 3 months old when I took my first flight. I have seen many places including Australia, USA, most European countries, Russia, etc. I have yet to discover Asia, as I've only been to Singapore for a few days, and Latin America! I am so grateful to have the opportunity to travel and discover the world. </p>
